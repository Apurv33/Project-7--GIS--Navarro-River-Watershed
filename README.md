# Project-7--GIS--Navarro-River-Watershed

Task 1 - The data is from a dataset covering the entire United States called the National Hydrography Dataset
(NHD) and this particular version is NHDPlus, version 2, which comes with some additional attribute
information. The NHD includes information and features for rivers, water bodies, and watersheds in the
US. In this case, we're displaying the rivers (flowlines) on our map.

Task 2 - For this project, we're interested in the Navarro River watershed on the coast of northern California.
Watersheds are often good areas of interest because in using them for boundaries, we usually preserve
ecological units within them rather than artificially splitting them up. In running an analysis at the scale
of a watershed, you can see important interactions at work. If you find your watersheds are splitting up For this project, we're interested in the Navarro River watershed on the coast of northern California.

Task 3 - In order to subset our stream data to the navarro river watershed, we need to first select the streams
that are part of the watershed. A selection is similar to when you highlight a sentence with your cursor in
a word processor - you're telling ArcGIS that you want to do operations only on that group of features (in
this case, streams). Once we have a selection, we can manipulate it to make a new dataset with just the
selected items.
